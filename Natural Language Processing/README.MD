As even handed as the US government tries to be when assisting other countries, this is the most sensitive kind of assistance out there because the US government is intervening directly in other countries' political affairs. Therefore, it is an important step to take the time to understand the needs of other countries in order to put together a strategy to combat health and social issues that affect the well-being of people. When countries publish reports in different languages it would be hard to gauge the understanding of their sociopolitical climate and how they want to address social issues. In order to enhance the US government diplomacy, natural language processing (NLP) will be used to analyze a Mexican government report to help understand what their current status is as a country and to measure aganist what the US understands of sociopolitical context of Mexico by analyzing a US government report of Mexico. NLP could objectively help decrease tensions between the two border countries and build relations by enabling a step towards better communication and understanding. 

Above are notebooks of my work that explain my step by step process of analyzing the government reports using NLP techniques and an LDA model.
