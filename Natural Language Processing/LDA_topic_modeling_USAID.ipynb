       " \n",
       "\n",
       "The Regional Development Cooperation Strategy (RDCS) for Central America and Mexico (CAM) lays the \n",
       "foundation for USAID’s presence in the region, and solidifies the commitment of USAID Missions in \n",
       "Central America and Mexico to close collaboration and enhanced cooperation to strategically target the \n",
       "region’s most pressing development challenges. By increasing communication, through a multi-level \n",
       "approach that includes the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and Central America \n",
       "Mission leadership and technical teams, USAID/CAM will serve as a regional convener, facilitating the \n",
       "sharing of ideas, successes, and lessons learned throughout the region. Against this backdrop of greater \n",
       "partnership, USAID/CAM will pursue ways to assist and bolster missions’ efforts and redefine the way in \n",
       "which regional platforms interact with and provide support to missions in Central America as they seek \n",
       "to address the region’s most pressing development challenges. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "The RDCS addresses U.S. foreign policy priorities and correlated development challenges in the region, \n",
       "including: ineffective governance; the evolving security situation, specifically the pervasive crime and \n",
       "violence affecting the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras; slow \n",
       "economic growth and integration; climate change and high vulnerability to natural disasters; and \n",
       "HIV/AIDS. Specifically, the RDCS is informed by the recent surge in migration by Central Americans, \n",
       "notably children and youth, to the U.S., which indicates that the serious and long-standing challenges in \n",
       "the region are worsening. Increased migration has, in turn, contributed to the disintegration of the \n",
       "family structure, with fragmented families increasingly unable to provide stability and structure for \n",
       "children and youth. With few social ties, little opportunity, and facing a real fear of crime and violence, \n",
       "children and youth turn to migration as a viable alternative to life in Central America. Because many of \n",
       "these issues span the region, crossing borders and affecting multiple populations, a regional strategy is \n",
       "best suited to respond to these regional development challenges, in close coordination with bilateral \n",
       "missions. Moreover, doing so in a holistic way that recognizes the interrelated nature of these issues is \n",
       "paramount. Programming that eschews traditional sectoral stovepipes, and contemplates the linkages \n",
       "between citizen security, economic growth, and global climate change, will enable USAID/CAM to \n",
       "contribute to comprehensive regional change. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "In alignment with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (CEN Strategy), which lays out an \n",

       "governance and security, and the complementary Plan of the Alliance for the Prosperity of the Northern \n",
       "Triangle (Alliance for Prosperity), presented by the Northern Triangle governments, the RDCS reflects \n",
       "the shared responsibility that the USG and Central American and Mexican governments have to \n",
       "promoting safety and stability in the region. As such, this RDCS will work towards the shared goal of a \n",
       "more inclusive, prosperous, transparent, and safe Central America region to achieve the following \n",

       "the key pillars of the CEN Strategy and the Alliance for Prosperity. For example, in support of the CEN \n",
       "Strategy’s prosperity pillar, the RDCS will improve trade facilitation and agricultural value chains across \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "transboundary natural resource management. In alignment with the governance pillar, activities will \n",
       "strengthen countries’ compliance with international human rights standards, institutionalizing the fair \n",
       "and humane treatment of all citizens across the region. Security activities will ensure the gathering and \n",
       "dissemination of reliable data and crime statistics to inform decision-making and prevention plans \n",
       "across the region. The RDCS will build and support regional youth involvement in political advocacy and \n",
       "alliance building within the citizen security area. To ensure sustainability of results in the region, USAID’s \n",
       "bilateral missions will continue to work in partnership with Central American governments to improve \n",
       "service delivery. Through the RDCS, USAID/CAM will bolster these efforts by creating opportunities for \n",
       "host country governments to dialogue on common regional challenges and facilitate trilateral \n",
       "cooperation among willing donors. The RDCS will also support the harmonization of policies and \n",
       "regulations to ensure enforcement of critical actions is consistent across borders. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "Further, USAID/CAM will seek, in coordination with LAC and bilateral missions, to synchronize reporting \n",
       "on the CEN Strategy by developing, collating, aggregating, and processing common regional indicators \n",
       "that track progress towards the CEN Strategy’s implementation. This will effectively release the \n",
       "reporting burden from missions in the region, and ensure consistency in communication on progress \n",
       "and impact made in the region. In addition, USAID/CAM will support the Central America Learning \n",
       "Agenda, which includes systematic coordination on evaluations, assessments, analysis, and other \n",
       "learning tools, through a shared commitment to identify gaps in knowledge, seek out programmatic \n",
       "congruencies, and capture development results to inform future programming. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "By introducing new solutions to development challenges USAID/CAM will test new approaches, based \n",
       "on analysis and evaluation, to expedite development results. For example, new programming will create \n",
       "a regional training academy wherein crime prevention experts and violence interrupters share and learn \n",
       "about evidence-based practices on citizen security-related topics. Similarly, by introducing community-\n",
       "based management systems for protected biodiverse areas, USAID/CAM will ensure better management \n",
       "of local resources, promote sustainable livelihoods and decent work, and increase economic opportunity \n",
       "in coastal communities. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "Further, USAID/CAM will seek to institutionalize the application of science, technology, and innovation \n",
       "as tools for smart development. For example, applying technology to develop and facilitate the sharing \n",
       "of a regional registry of disappeared people, and applying science-based standards to regional exports to \n",
       "expand market access. Moreover, to leverage USAID funds, USAID/CAM will look to partnerships to \n",
       "capitalize on the strengths of private sector partners. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "In recognition of the evolving development landscape wherein an increasing number of emerging \n",
       "donors are interested in lending their expertise to Central America, USAID/CAM will capitalize on the \n",
       "opportunity to partner with new actors. Specifically, through trilateral cooperation, USAID/CAM will \n",

       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "RDCS activities will maintain a central focus on the Northern Triangle countries, but will strategically \n",
       "engage in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and countries in the region without a USAID \n",
       "mission, including Costa Rica, Belize, and Panama, where USAID/CAM will coordinate with the respective \n",

       "\n",
       "Throughout the life of the RDCS, USAID/CAM will ensure programming is truly regional in nature and \n",
       "complements and enhances bilateral programs in the region. By applying a set of criteria, which are \n",
       "detailed below, the RDCS will pilot innovative approaches for potential regional scale-up, share and \n",
       "disseminate best practices and lessons learned across the region, and utilize its position to introduce \n",

       "unique platform to promote key local actors, regional entities and other bilateral donors seeking \n",
       "trilateral cooperation as partners in achieving common goals and supporting broader foreign policy \n",
       "priorities. Additionally, the regional program will introduce new mechanisms that respond to the needs \n",

       "\n",
       "Equally important is regional coordination, which will enable successful regional programming \n",

       "coordination, that includes mission director engagement, as well as program office and technical \n",
       "coordination. Moreover, USAID/CAM has established a system by which bilateral missions’ staff is \n",
       "directly involved in the design and procurement of new activities, as well as other programmatic issues. \n",
       "USAID/CAM will provide resources for staffing in bilateral missions for greater visibility and input into \n",
