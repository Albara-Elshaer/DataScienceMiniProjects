###### The dataset on the World Bank projects is available in a JSON file. I first load the data as a Pandas dataframe and find that China, Indonesia and Vietnam have the most projects with the World Bank. Then I load the JSON file as a string, normalize the project themes, and find that environment and natural resources management, rural development and human development are the project themes with the highest frequencies.
