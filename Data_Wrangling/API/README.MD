###### In this mini project I pulled some data from the Qunadl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.As a first step, I registered a free account on the http://www.quandl.com website in which through the registration process was provided a unique API key. For this mini project, I focused on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. Qaundl has a large number of data sources, but, unfortunately, most of them require a Premium subscription. 

###### I analyzed the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X. I used the *requests* package to obtain the data and worked with utility functions that are friendly to Python's native data structures: dictionaries.
