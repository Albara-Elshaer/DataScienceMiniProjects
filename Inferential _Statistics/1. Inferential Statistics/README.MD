**_In this mini project, I simulated 50,000 data point structure with a known normal distributionworked to show fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference such as what a sampling distribution is and how the Central Limit Theorem applies. Using this simulated data, I sampled and calculated probabilities from a normal distribution, estimated the standard deviation of a population (the population parameter) from a sample, and calculated critical values and confidence intervals._**
