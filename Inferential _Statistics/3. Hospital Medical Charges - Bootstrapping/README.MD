**_In my other mini project I used the t-test to calculate statistical values, such as  the p-value for the observed difference between the means of two different groups, which in this case are insured vs. non-insured medical cases. For this mini project, I used the bootstrap approach (a little less theoretical) to calculate the confidence interval lower limit, to test the assumption that the variances of the two groups (insured vs. non-insured) were equal, and to calculate the p-value for the difference between the means of the two groups and compared with the result obtained using the frequentist approach.
