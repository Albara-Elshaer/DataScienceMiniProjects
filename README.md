Welcome! This repository contains my data science mini-projects, ranging from data wrangling and statistical inference to machine learning and advanced data visualization.

Data Wrangling
Practice cleaning/tidying up messy data using pandas - API, JSON, raw text and working with databases.

Inferential Statistics
Useful inferential statistics for drawing conclusions and predicting outcomes. Contains three miniprojects :

Human Body Temperature - hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance
Examining Racial Discrimination - does race have a significant impact on the rate of callbacks?
Reducing Hospital Readmissions - statistical analysis to reduce readmissions to hospitals.

Machine Learning
To learn various machine learning models, their advantages and limitations. Contains the following miniprojects :
Boston House Pricing - predicting housing prices in Boston using linear regression
Heights and Weights - using logistic regression to classify gender
Predicting Movie Ratings - use naive bayes algorithm to accurately predict movie ratings based on their reviews
Customer Segmentation - employ k-means clustering and associated accuracy metrics to partitioning problems

P.S. If you are getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page, not to worry. There is a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool. Sometimes GitHub fails to render the ipynb notebooks, I believe that is a recurring issue GitHub is dealing with in their back end regarding their notebook. If you want to see my work, please open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.
Step 1: Open the link "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" on your browser. 
Step 2: Copy the link of the notebook page and paste it in the search bar on nbviewer. Press enter and you should be able to see the work.
