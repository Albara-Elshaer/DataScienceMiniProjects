# **Welcome! 
### This repository contains my data science mini-projects, ranging from data wrangling and statistical inference to machine learning and advanced data visualization.**

#### Data Wrangling
Practice cleaning/tidying up messy data using pandas - API, JSON, raw text and working with databases:

## Inferential Statistics
Useful inferential statistics for drawing conclusions and predicting outcomes. Contains three miniprojects:



## Machine Learning
Various machine learning models, their advantages and limitations. Contains the following miniprojects:


## *P.S.* 
###### If you are getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page, there might be a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool. Sometimes GitHub fails to render the ipynb notebooks, this has been a recurring issue GitHub is dealing with in their back end. But not to worry, I have a quick solution if you want to see my work. Please open the notebook you want to see using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.*
###### *Step 1: Open the link "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" on your browser.* 
###### *Step 2: Copy the link of the notebook page and paste it in the search bar on nbviewer. Press enter and you should be able to see my work.*
