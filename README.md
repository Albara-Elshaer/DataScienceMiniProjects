# **Welcome to Albara Elshaer's Data Science Repository!** 
### This repository contains my data science mini-projects, ranging from data wrangling and statistical inference to machine learning and advanced data visualization. You can click on the links below that will take you directly to my Python Jupyter notebook or you can click on the folders above. To read a quick synopsis of the project please click on the folders and you will see a README section.  

### Data Wrangling Projects
Practice cleaning/tidying up messy data using pandas - API, JSON, raw text and working with databases:
* [World Bank Development Projects](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Data_Wrangling/JSON/World%20Bank%20Data%20.ipynb)
* [Quandl Financial Market Data](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Data_Wrangling/API/Using%20API%20and%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

### Inferential Statistics Projects
Useful inferential statistics for drawing conclusions and predicting outcomes:
* [Inferential Statistics](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Inferential%20_Statistics/1.%20Inferential%20Statistics/Inferential%20Statistics.ipynb)
* [Hospital Medical Charges](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Inferential%20_Statistics/2.%20Hospital%20Medical%20Charges/Hospital%20Medical%20Charges.ipynb)
* [Hospital Medical Charges - Bootstrapping](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Inferential%20_Statistics/3.%20Hospital%20Medical%20Charges%20-%20Bootstrapping/Hospital%20Medical%20Charges%20-%20Bootstrapping.ipynb)
* [Hospital Medical Charges - Bayesian](https://github.com/Albara-Elshaer/DataScienceMiniProjects/blob/master/Inferential%20_Statistics/4.%20Hospital%20Medical%20Charges%20-%20Bayesian/Hospital%20Medical%20Charges%20-%20Bayesian.ipynb)


### Machine Learning Projects 
Various machine learning models, their advantages and limitations: 


#### *P.S.* 
###### If you are getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page, there might be a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool. Sometimes GitHub fails to render the ipynb notebooks, this has been a recurring issue GitHub is dealing with in their back end. But not to worry, I have a quick solution if you want to see my work. Please open the notebook you want to see using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.*
###### *Step 1: Open the link "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" on your browser.* 
###### *Step 2: Copy the link of the notebook page and paste it in the search bar on nbviewer. Press enter and you should be able to see my work.*
